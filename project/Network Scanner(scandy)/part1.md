In this video, I go over how to set up a virtual penetration testing lab with VirtualBox, Metasploitable2, and Metasploitable3. I'll walk you through the process of configuring the virtual machines to communicate with one another over a secure private network. I also show you how to use Python and argparse to pass command-line options to your code. Whether you're a beginner or an expert in cybersecurity, I believe you'll learn something from this video.
