n this video, you'll learn how to use Python to create a network scanner capable of detecting devices on your network, gathering their MAC addresses, and identifying the manufacturer. I'll also demonstrate how to use OS fingerprinting to determine the operating system of each device. Anyone interested in network security or network administration will benefit from this tutorial.
