## Introduction

Foundational knowledge in networking, devices on networks, protocols, vulnerabilities and network attacks will aid a security professional in understanding how networks operate and how to protect them from attacks.

Network is a collection of devices that are connected together to share resources and information. The devices on a network are called nodes. The nodes can be computers, printers, or any other device that is capable of sending and/or receiving data generated by other nodes on the network.

### Types of networks

- Local Area Network (LAN): LAN is a network that is confined to a relatively small area. It is generally limited to a geographic area such as a writing lab, school, or building. Rarely are LAN computers more than a mile apart.
- Wide Area Network (WAN): WAN is a network that covers a broad area. WANs are used to connect LANs and other types of networks together so that users and computers in one location can communicate with users and computers in other locations. Examples of WANs are the Internet, cellular networks, and WANs of large corporations that have offices in different cities.

### Network Devices

- Network Interface Card (NIC): A network interface card (NIC) is a computer circuit board or card that is installed in a computer so that it can be connected to a network. Personal computers and workstations on a local area network (LAN) typically contain a network interface card specifically designed for the LAN transmission technology, such as Ethernet or token ring.
  
- Modem: A modem is a device or program that enables a computer to transmit data over, for example, telephone or cable lines. Computer information is stored digitally, whereas information transmitted over telephone lines is transmitted in the form of analog waves. A modem converts between these two forms.
  
- Switch: A switch is a device in a computer network that connects other devices together. Multiple data cables are plugged into a switch to enable communication between different networked devices. Switches manage the flow of data across a network by transmitting a received network packet only to the one or more devices for which the packet is intended. Each networked device connected to a switch can be identified by its MAC address, allowing the switch to direct the flow of traffic maximizing the security and efficiency of the network.
  
- Router: A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. A data packet is typically forwarded from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an inter-network (e.g. the Internet) until it reaches its destination node.
  
- Hub: A hub is a physical layer networking device which is used to connect multiple devices in a network. They are generally used to connect computers in a LAN. A hub has many ports in it. A computer which intends to be connected to the network is plugged in to one of these ports. When the data packets arrive at the hub, they are copied to all the ports of the hub. Thus, the data packets are sent to all the computers connected to the hub. The hub does not perform any filtering of data. It is a very simple device which does not have any intelligence to filter the data packets. It is also called as a multi-port repeater.

## Introduction to Network Protocols

A network protocol is a set of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and structure of data. Network protocols are designed to allow networked devices to communicate with each other. They are used to define how messages are formatted and transmitted between devices, and how devices identify and communicate with each other.

### Three Categories of Network Protocols

- Communication Protocols
  - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
  - User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
  - Domain Name System (DNS)
- Management Protocols
  - Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
  - Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
- Security Protocols
  - Secure Shell (SSH)
  - secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
  - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) 

### Additional Network Protocols

|Protocol|Port|
|--------|----|
|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)|67(servers) /68(client)|
|File Transfer Protocol (FTP)|20(data) /21(control)|
|Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)|N/A|
|Telnet|23|
|Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)|587(encrypted,TLS)|
|Post Office Protocol (POP)|110(unencrypted) 995(encrypted)|
|Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)|TCP 143(Unencrypted), TCP 993(encrypted,SSL/TLS)|
|Secure Shell (SSH)|22|

## The evolution of wireless security protocols

### Overview

- Wireless internet access aka Wi-Fi refers to a set of standards that define communication for wireless LANs.
- Wi-Fi is based on the IEEE 802.11 standard.

### Evolution

- Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP): WEP was the first security protocol introduced for wireless networks. It was introduced in 1999 and was part of the original 802.11 standard. WEP was designed to provide the same level of security as that of wired networks. However, WEP was found to have several security flaws and was deprecated in 2004.
- Wi-Fi Protected Access (WAP): WAP was introduced in 2003 to address the security issues of WEP. WAP was designed to be backward compatible with WEP. WAP was also found to have several security flaws and was deprecated in 2004.  
  - WPA addressed the flaws of WEP by using a protocol called Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP). WPA encryption algorithm uses larger secret keys than WEPs, making it more difficult to guess the key by trial and error.
  - WPA also uses a message integrity check to prevent an attacker from altering and resending data packets. WPA also uses a technique called key mixing to combine the secret key with the initialization vector. This makes it more difficult for an attacker to decrypt the data packets.
  - Despite the security improvements of WPA, it still has vulnerabilities. Malicious actors can use a key reinstallation attack (or KRACK attack) to decrypt transmissions using WPA. Attackers can insert themselves in the WPA authentication handshake process and insert a new encryption key instead of the dynamic one assigned by WPA. If they set the new key to all zeros, it is as if the transmission is not encrypted at all.

- WPA2: WPA2 was introduced in 2004 to address the security issues of WPA. WPA2 was designed to be backward compatible with WEP and WPA. WPA2 is currently the most secure protocol for wireless networks. However, WPA2 is vulnerable to KRACK attacks. WPA3: WPA3 was introduced in 2018 to address the security issues of WPA2. WPA3 was designed to be backward compatible with WEP, WPA, and WPA2. WPA3 is currently the most secure protocol for wireless networks.
- WPA3
  - WPA3 addresses the authentication handshake vulnerability to KRACK attacks by using a stronger encryption algorithm called Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE).
  - SAE is a secure key establishment protocol that uses a password to create a strong cryptographic key. SAE is resistant to dictionary attacks and password guessing attacks.
  - WPA3 has increased encryption to make passwords more secure by using 128-bit encryption, with 192-bit encryption for enterprise networks.
