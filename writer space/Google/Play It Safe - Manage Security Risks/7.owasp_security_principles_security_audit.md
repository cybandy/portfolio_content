## Introduction

As stated several times previously, protecting assets and data is the main responsibility of a security analyst. Fortunately, there are principles and guidelines such as NIST frameworks and the CIA triad to help achieve minimize risks and threats.

## OWASP Security Principles

1. Minimize attack surface area: An attack surface area refers to all the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit, like attack vectors, which are pathways attackers use to penetrate security defenses.
   To minimize attack surface area sec teams might disable software features, restrict access to assets/resources, introduce complex authentication requirements.
2. Principle of least privilege: It means assigning users the minimum access required to fulfill their task. This means only individuals working on billing can view customer financial data and even fewer wil have the permission to change or delete it. In the event that an employee credential is compromised this ensures that damage caused is reduced
3. Defense in depth: This means that an organization should have multiple security controls that address risks and threats in different ways. E.g multi-factor authentication(MFA)
4. Separation of duties: This means that no one person should control an entire high risk transaction from start to finish. For example, an employee may submit an invoice for payment to a vendor (or for reimbursement to themselves), but it must be approved by a manager prior to payment; in another instance, almost anyone may submit a proposal for a change to a system configuration, but the request must go through technical and management review and gain approval, before it can be implemented. These steps can prevent fraud.
   **The ff are knowledge from isc2 CC course: Domain 3 - Access control**
   - Dual control: This usually apply to banks where there are two separate combination locks on the door of a vault. The vault can be only be opened if the two work together
   - Two-person rule: This is a security strategy that requires a minimum of two people to be in an area together, making it impossible for a person to be in the area alone. This area can be a very high risk security area of an organization
5. Keep security simple: As the name suggests, when implementing security controls, unnecessarily complicated solutions should be avoided because they can become unmanageable. The more complex the security controls are, the harder it is for people to work collaboratively.
6. Fix security issues correctly: Technology is a great tool, but can also present challenges. When a security incident occurs, security professionals are expected to identify the root cause quickly. From there, it's important to correct any identified vulnerabilities and conduct tests to ensure that repairs are successful. E.g [Critical zero-day vulnerability in libwebp](https://socradar.io/critical-zero-day-vulnerability-in-libwebp-cve-2023-4863-reassigned-as-cve-2023-5129/)
7. Establish secure defaults: This principle means that the optimal security state of an application is also its default state for users; it should take extra work to make the application insecure.
8. Fail securely: Fail securely means that when a control fails or stops, it should do so by defaulting to its most secure option. For example, when a firewall fails it should simply close all connections and block all new ones, rather than start accepting everything.
9. Don’t trust services: Many organizations work with third-party partners. These outside partners often have different security policies than the organization does. And the organization shouldn’t explicitly trust that their partners’ systems are secure. For example, if a third-party vendor tracks reward points for airline customers, the airline should ensure that the balance is accurate before sharing that information with their customers.
10. Avoid security by obscurity: The security of key systems should not rely on keeping details hidden. Consider the following example from OWASP (2016):

The security of an application should not rely on keeping the source code secret. Its security should rely upon many other factors, including reasonable password policies, defense in depth, business transaction limits, solid network architecture, and fraud and audit controls.

## Security Audit

A security audit is a review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations. Audits are independent reviews that evaluate whether an organization is meeting internal and external criteria. Internal criteria include outlined policies, procedures, and best practices. External criteria include regulatory compliance, laws, and federal regulations.

Additionally, a security audit can be used to assess an organization's established security controls. As a reminder, security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.

Audits help ensure that security checks are made (i.e., daily monitoring of security information and event management dashboards), to identify threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. This helps maintain an organization’s security posture. And, if there are security issues, a remediation process must be in place.

### Goals and objectives of an audit

The goal of an audit is to ensure an organization's information technology (IT) practices are meeting industry and organizational standards. The objective is to identify and address areas of remediation and growth. Audits provide direction and clarity by identifying what the current failures are and developing a plan to correct them.

Security audits must be performed to safeguard data and avoid penalties and fines from governmental agencies. The frequency of audits is dependent on local laws and federal compliance regulations.

### Factors that affect audits

Factors that determine the types of audits an organization implements include:

- Industry type

- Organization size

- Ties to the applicable government regulations

- A business’s geographical location

- A business decision to adhere to a specific regulatory compliance

### The role of frameworks and controls in audits

Along with compliance, it’s important to mention the role of frameworks and controls in security audits. Frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and the international standard for information security (ISO 27000) series are designed to help organizations prepare for regulatory compliance security audits. By adhering to these and other relevant frameworks, organizations can save time when conducting external and internal audits. Additionally, frameworks, when used alongside controls, can support organizations’ ability to align with regulatory compliance requirements and standards.  

There are three main categories of controls to review during an audit, which are administrative and/or managerial, technical, and physical controls. To learn more about specific controls related to each category, click the following link and select “Use Template.”

### Audit checklist

It’s necessary to create an audit checklist before conducting an audit. A checklist is generally made up of the following areas of focus:

1. Identify the scope of the audit

    - The audit should:
      - List assets that will be assessed (e.g., firewalls are configured correctly, PII is secure, physical assets are locked, etc.)
      - Note how the audit will help the organization achieve its desired goals
      - Indicate how often an audit should be performed
      - Include an evaluation of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to make sure they are working as intended and being implemented by employees

2. Complete a risk assessment
    - A risk assessment is used to evaluate identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards (i.e., regulations).

3. Conduct the audit
    - When conducting an internal audit, you will assess the security of the identified assets listed in the audit scope.

4. Create a mitigation plan
    -A mitigation plan is a strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that can negatively affect the organization’s security posture.

5. Communicate results to stakeholders

The end result of this process is providing a detailed report of findings, suggested improvements needed to lower the organization's level of risk, and compliance regulations and standards the organization needs to adhere to.
